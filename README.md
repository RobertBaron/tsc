# Improve readability with Typescript when working with large numbers.

```javascript
class AmountInput {
  // To create a more readable number instead of 99999999 which is hard to read, we can use _ to separate the numbers 
  // and make it more readable with less brain effort.
  private static MAX_ALLOWED = 99_999_999;
  
  amount: number = 0;
  
  formatMillion() {
    return `${this.amount / 1_000_000}M`;
  }
}
```

# Class usar safe with strict property initializacion

```javascript
class Library {
  titles: string[];
}

// Later on
const library = new Library();
const shortTitles = library.titles.filter(title => title.length < 5); // This will throw since library has not being initialized.
```

We should enable `"strictPropertyInitialization": true` in our tsconfig.json, remember that you also need strictNullChecks enabled.

This will warn on about this types of problems at compile time.

```javascript
class Library {
  titles: string[]; // By enabling the rule, now tsc will complain here.
}

// Later on
const library = new Library();
const shortTitles = library.titles.filter(title => title.length < 5); // This will throw since library has not being initialized.
```

Now we can do something like
```javascript
class Library {
  titles: string[] | undefined; 
}

// Later on
const library = new Library();
const shortTitles = library.titles.filter(title => title.length < 5); // Now TSC will complain here, since library might be undefined.
```

If you do that, it means that now you will have to safe guard your code like this:
```javascript
class Library {
  titles: string[] | undefined; 
}

// Later on
const library = new Library();
const shortTitles = library.titles?.filter(title => title.length < 5);
```
Now if library is undefined, the compiler will be happy and so your code.

If you don't want to protect the error everywhere you try to use `library` you can do:
```javascript
class Library {
  titles: string[] = ["Mocha Vanilla"]; 
}

// Later on
const library = new Library();
const shortTitles = library.titles.filter(title => title.length < 5);
```

or in the constructor to make the compiler happy
```javascript
class Library {
  titles: string[]; 
  
  constructor() {
    this.titles = ["Latte Vanilla"]
  }
}

// Later on
const library = new Library();
const shortTitles = library.titles.filter(title => title.length < 5);
```

Both are valid options and will make the error go away.

If you initialize in the constructor, you need to make sure every path is covered, let's look at the example:

```javascript
class Library {
  titles: string[]; 
  
  constructor(launchDay: boolean) {
    if (launchDay) {
      this.titles = ["Latte Vanilla"]
    } else {
      this.titles = []; // If you don't cover this path, typescript will also complain.
    }
  }
}

// Later on
const library = new Library();
const shortTitles = library.titles.filter(title => title.length < 5);
```

All of this is great, but what if this the class properties will be initialized at runtime? like fetching the titles from the server?
In that case you can use [definite assignment assertion modifiers](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-7.html#:~:text=Definite%20Assignment%20Assertions,TypeScript's%20analyses%20cannot%20detect%20so.) this will tell typescrypt that the property will be definetely initialized.

```javascript
class Library {
  titles!: string[]; // Notice this '!' modifier.
  
  constructor() {
    initialize();
  }
}
```

The importance of this is that you as developer will be aware of the potential error that you might have.

# Use "in" operator for automatic type inference
```javascript
 interface Admin {
  id: string;
  role: string;
 }
 
 interface User {
  email: string;
 }
 
 function redirect(usr: Admin | User) {
  if (/* check if is admin or not*/) {
    routeAdmin(usr.role);
  } else {
    routeUser(usr.email);
  }
 }
```

Now how can we figure it out if user is an admin or a user? You guess it, typescript will tell us!
```javascript
 function redirect(usr: Admin | User) {
  if ((<Admin>usr).role !== undefined) {
    routeAdmin(usr.role); // typescript complains here cause it might still be an user!
  } else {
    routeUser(usr.email);  // typescript complains here cause it might still be an admin!
  }
 }
```

We can also create a custom type guard and typescript will imply the type correctly in the `redirect` function
```
function isAdmin(usr: Admin | User): usr is Admin {
  return (<Admin>usr).role !== undefined;
}

 function redirect(usr: Admin | User) {
  if (isAdmin(usr)) {
    routeAdmin(usr.role); 
  } else {
    routeUser(usr.email); 
  }
 }
```

The problem with this solution is that you are going to be adding to much extra code everytime you need to tell typescript to figure the type correctly.

There is a better way, the [in](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/in) operator. 
```
 function redirect(usr: Admin | User) {
  if ("role" in usr) { // checks if the property role exists IN usr, since it only exists for Admin, typescript will infer correctly that it is an Admin.
    routeAdmin(usr.role); 
  } else {
    routeUser(usr.email); 
  }
 }
```

# Infer types in switch statements.

```javascript
interface Action {
  type: string;
}

export class Add implements Action {
  readonly type: string = "Add";
  constructor(public payload: string) {}
}


export class RemoveAll implements Action {
  readonly type: string = "Remove All";
}
```

```javascript
interface ITodoState {
  todos: string[];
}

function todoReducer(
  action: Action,
  state: ITodoState = { todos: [] }
): ITodoState {
  switch(action.type) {
    case "Add": {
      return {
        todos: [...state.todos, action.payload] // Since action only has a type defined, typescript will complain
      }
    }
    
    case "Remove All": {
      return {
        todos: []
      }
    }
  }
}
```

We can add an optional attribute to the Action interface
```javascript
interface Action {
  type: string;
  payload?: any; // but in here we not actually checking for the type of the payload.
}
```

Another thing we can do is to cast inside the Add action as follows:
```javascript
case "Add": {
  const payload = (<Add>action).payload; // If payload is other than a string, is going to fail.
  return {
    todos: [...state.todos, payload];
  }
}
```

Again the problem here is that you will be casting for every action that you have.
Since we know if action has a unique type attribute, we can define them as follows so that typescript can differenciate one from another,
we do this by removing the `:string` definition in the type object to tell the compiler that the type is "Add" and not any other generic string.
It is important to notice that the property should be `readonly` so that typescript knows that it won't change to another type in the future.

```javascript
interface Action {
  type: string;
}

export class Add implements Action {
  readonly type = "Add";
  constructor(public payload: string) {}
}


export class RemoveAll implements Action {
  readonly type = "Remove All";
}
```

Now we need to create a finite list of all the types typescript needs to look at when searching for a class based on a string;

```javascript
export type TodoActions = Add | RemoveAll;
```

We can change now in our reducer that instead of receiving any type of actions, it will get a specific set of Actions `TodoActions`
```javascript
interface ITodoState {
  todos: string[];
}

function todoReducer(
  action: TodoActions, // Here
  state: ITodoState = { todos: [] }
): ITodoState {
  switch(action.type) {
    case "Add": {
      return {
        todos: [...state.todos, action.payload]
      }
    }
    
    case "Remove All": {
      const t = action; // If you hoover over `t` you will see that typescript now knows the type, based on the value
      return {
        todos: []
      }
    }
  }
}
```
What we are doing here is called "Discriminated Unions" you can read more about it [here](https://basarat.gitbook.io/typescript/type-system/discriminated-unions)

If we would like to add a new action
```javascript
export class RemoveOne implements Action {
  readonly type = "Remove One"
  constructor(public payload: number) {}
}

export type TodoActions = Add | RemoveAll | RemoveOne;
```
And you try to use it in the reducer like this:
```javascript 

function todoReducer(
  action: TodoActions, // Here
  state: ITodoState = { todos: [] }
): ITodoState {
  switch(action.type) {
    case "Add": {
      return {
        todos: [...state.todos, action.payload]
      }
    }
    
    case "Remove All": {
      const t = action; 
      return {
        todos: []
      }
    }
    
    case "Remove One": {
      return {
        todos: [...state.todos, action.payload] // wrong
      }
    }
  }
}
```

if we try to use it's payload which is of type number to the todo list that it is of type string typescripe will notice and throw an error, this is great because we are all protected.

The right way to do so is by:
```javascript
case "Remove One": {
  return {
    todos: state.todos.slice().splice(action.payload, 1)
  }
}
```

Finally, something very interesting, if you have defined all the actions, but you didn't implement of all them in the reducer, we can add an extra layer of protection by defining a default case for it.
```javascript
function todoReducer(
  action: TodoActions, // Here
  state: ITodoState = { todos: [] }
): ITodoState {
  switch(action.type) {
    case "Add": {
      return {
        todos: [...state.todos, action.payload]
      }
    }
    
    case "Remove All": {
      const t = action; 
      return {
        todos: []
      }
    }
    
    case "Remove One": {
      return {
        todos: [...state.todos, action.payload] // wrong
      }
    }
    default: {
      const x: never = action;
      // If you remove any case, you will see an error over the `x`
    }
  }
}
```

# Mapped Typed Modifiers

```javascript
interace IPet {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

type ReadonlyPet = {
  readonly [K in keyof IPet]: IPet[K]; // Apply bulk changes to all of the properties.
}
```

A piece of code like this is extremely useful if you want to guarante the inmutability state of the object.

```javascript
const pet: IPet = { name: 'bobby', age: 32 }; // mutable
const readonlyPet: ReadonlyPet = { name: 'bark', age 14 }; // inmutable

// try to apply mutation
pet.age = 6; // this is fine
readonlyPet.age = 5; // typescript will complain, age is readonly
```

If you want to make all of the pet properties optinal, you can do so with the same syntaxis.
```javascript
type ReadonlyPet = {
  readonly [K in keyof IPet]?: IPet[K]; // Apply bulk changes to all of the properties.
}
```

or make them all strings:
```javascript
type ReadonlyPet = {
  readonly [K in keyof IPet]?: string; // Apply bulk changes to all of the properties.
}
```

This feature also allows you to overwrite some properties
```javascript
interace IPet {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  favoritePark?: string; // added as optional
}

type ReadonlyPet = {
  readonly [K in keyof IPet]-?: string; // Remove any optional properties
}

// Since it now required, you need also to add the property to your objects.
const pet: IPet = { name: 'bobby', age: 32, favoritePark: 'NY' }; 
const readonlyPet: ReadonlyPet = { name: 'bark', age 14, favoritePark: 'SJ' };
```

Along with the `-` the `+` has been added as well, if you want to be explicit you can change it to:
```javascript
type ReadonlyPet = {
  +readonly [K in keyof IPet]-?: string;
}
```
This can be read as we are adding (+) a readonly flag and removing (-) optional properties.
